Instead of thinking about drawing commands in terms of bytes, what if I broke down all possible
information into the exact bits I need and can be configured.

Every X/Y coordinate should be defined beforehand.
Every possible stroke width should be defined.

Let's have values represent cross sections.

So if you're drawing something towrad the right that needs a left boundary, then a
value of 0 would include the leftmost pixel in the bounding box.  A value of 1
would exclude the left-most pixel.


That means we have 256 grid lines, which covers 255 pixels.

Ever drawing operation will relative to a grid line.

A: 
    stroke_diag: left_start=cap_left bottom_start=baseline left_end=a_left top_end=cap_top stroke_width=cap_width 
    stroke_horz: top=cap_bar_top left=?? right=center stroke_width=cap_width 
    reflect
B:
    stroke_vert: top=cap_top bottom=baseline stroke_width=cap_width
    stroke_horz: left=cap_left
